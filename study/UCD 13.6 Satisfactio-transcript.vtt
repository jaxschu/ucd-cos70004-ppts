00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.050
Hello and welcome to Topic 13 of user Senate design.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,86,100,98,41,87,100]}

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.350
This is the six and seven videos on satisfaction Measures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,92,100,96,49,100,100,99]}

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040
So after studying this particular topic, you should be able

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,99,100,99,99]}

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.630
to analyse and present data from measures off satisfaction from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,100,100,100,98,82,100,100]}

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.950
a usability evaluation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,94]}

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.380
Okay, So satisfaction represents a really important part of our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.760
evaluation of the user interface, so we can measure how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,82,100,100,100,99,99,100,100]}

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.920
fast and how error free and everything people are.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,42,99,100,99,100,99]}

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.630
But we're also very interested in what they think about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,70,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.160
how they feel about user interface serve you any way

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,93,97,56,56]}

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.130
we can get to this is to ask people about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,99,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.580
their feelings and attitudes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100]}

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.810
So we turned to use things like questionnaires.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,64,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.990
So what we're going to do in this beer is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,83,85]}

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.490
look at the data that we're collecting from questionnaires and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,99,100,93,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.250
how we might analyse that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.860
So you can refer back Teo videos for Topic 12,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,89,100,100,47,98,100,99,100]}

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.100
where we talked about some of these, you know, tools

NOTE CONF {"raw":[62,100,100,100,100,100,100,98,98,100]}

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.550
that we're using questionnaire tools if you haven't done that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,96,100,94,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.010
already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.300
Okay, so one of the first things one of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.900
first measures of satisfactions that we get from participants is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.040
their task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,98]}

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.200
Difficulty rating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.030
All right, so remember, we've got like a task we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[72,72,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.660
might get click some information from them, and this information

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,79,94,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.880
here would pertain Teo completion of the task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,90,71,49,100,100,100,100]}

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.180
But then we have our task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,99]}

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.100
Difficulty rating.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.580
Okay.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92]}

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.640
And this is the one where we're looking at people's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,100,99,100,100,95]}

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.500
satisfaction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.420
Okay, so then we can when we finished the evaluation,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,100,100,100,100,100,91,95,98,99]}

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.190
we can go and have a look at the Google

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95,100,98,100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.690
spreadsheet, and then we can see that there is a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.920
row for every participant and that we will have, you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,100,100,100,100,100,59,71,100,67]}

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.530
know, the information that the participant put in on in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,74,100]}

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.930
particular for this, we're interested in the difficulty reading for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,81,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790
each of the task.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,86]}

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.930
So here we've got Task one and the data for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,82,94,100,100,98,100,100,99,100]}

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.150
each participant and task, too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,93,68,51]}

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.630
So it's not really rocket science doing this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,98,99,100,99,100,100]}

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.110
A we really need to do is put in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,51,66,100,99,99,100,100,100,99]}

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.860
table so that your audience can see what the readings

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,84]}

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.140
were.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83]}

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.910
Each task so typically with our table's just like our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,99,77,77,58,100,100,98]}

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.890
demographic table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.390
We want to match this up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,87,79,100,100,100]}

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.780
We'll have rules for each set, a participant data, and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,100,57,100,100,100,84,100,100,67]}

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.060
then we've got columns for our data itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,100,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.910
So here I've got two columns related to task difficulties.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,97,99,59,99,98,100]}

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.530
So we've got for Task one and Task, too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,64,100,60,99,98,100,79,41]}

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.920
And then we put those in for each of those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.570
tasks for each participant on DH.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,59,85,100,100]}

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.070
Then later on will round out this table with our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,75,100,99,100,100,83,81]}

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.320
sussed scores, and I recommend to a friend score a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,100,99,100,41,92,80,97,100]}

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.200
couple of important notes about doing the table again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.850
Make sure that you've got a caption which describes what's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,99,98,98,99,100,100,73]}

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.160
in the table and also explain your any ratings that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,99,99]}

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.280
Aaron here, any metrics, So attacks difficulty.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,91,100,99,99,32,100]}

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.650
One equals very easy.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,99,100,100]}

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.750
Five equals very hard without this information.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,99,96,100,100]}

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.090
It's like, really hard for people.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.980
Teo interpret your table because they don't really know what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,100,99,100,100,99,100,99,99,99]}

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.570
three or one is, which is good and which is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,95,100,100]}

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.970
bad.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.800
All right, so the next I'm questionnaire that we've got

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,100,51,98,100,99,100]}

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.330
is our system usability scale or arse us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,99,100,100,91,91]}

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.910
So you should remember this from your evaluation to on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,100,99,100,100,100,100,78,80]}

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.230
DH here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[47,68]}

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.020
We've got our sets of questions each relating tio some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,50,99,100,100,100,99,64,99]}

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.230
aspect of the EU's ability of the user interface and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,54,54,100,94,94,99,100]}

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.930
remember that we've got our positive scored questions and are

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,100,98,100,100,99,71,28]}

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.360
negative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.100
Scored questions on that does give us some interesting challenges

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.270
when we're tryingto generate a score for these question it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,63,47]}

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.760
this questionnaire so have.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100]}

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.480
First off, though, when you go into Google forms, you'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,100,100,100,100,100,99,98]}

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.080
notice that they have a summary of your data in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,85,100,100,93]}

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.820
Google forms very helpfully, although unfortunately what Google Google form

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,100,99,99,100,100,100,99,75]}

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.250
Summary charts are not useful at all in this case.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.430
All right, so this is not the way that we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.610
represent this data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.950
What we're going to do is take calculate one score

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,96,100]}

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.450
that represents this us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98]}

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.980
This's totally irrelevant and not useful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.240
So so do not use that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.630
Do not copy them.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.150
Don't do anything with, um, don't don't ignore them completely.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,72,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.390
What we need to do is get our data from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.460
the spreadsheet and calculate the suss school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,98,100,100,100,85,52]}

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.240
Now you remember if you you remember, if you had

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,100,100,97,99,100,100,100,99]}

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.900
a look at the videos on the satisfaction question is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,68,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.350
from Topic 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100]}

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.530
We talked about the idea of the positive and negative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.890
scoring on, also that we need to multiply by 2.5

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,84,82,100,100]}

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.350
that final score to get a score out of 100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,94,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.700
So let's have a look at our spreadsheet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,99,100,63,42,75]}

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.570
So we've got our positively schooled questions, and with our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,79,100,51,99,100,64,58]}

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.190
positives, Lee scored questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[75,39,100,99]}

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.490
If someone strongly agrees, then that is four points.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,99,99,100,100,100,97,100]}

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.690
All right, which is the way it was scored in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,89,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100]}

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.680
the Google form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,98]}

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.720
Naturally, however, and so we can use that number when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.080
we're calculating our suss score without any changes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,100,55,56,95,99,100,99]}

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.950
So that's fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.900
But for negatively scored square questions, the strongly agree we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,92,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.250
should score is four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,88]}

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.520
However, however, for the negatively school question, we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,99,99,100,100,99,99]}

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.050
strongly agree to equal zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,98,98,100,100]}

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.600
Okay, because if they strongly agree with the negative question

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,100,100,97,100,97,99,55,100,99]}

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.850
that that is really bad for our user interface.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,99,68,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.560
So we need to actually just the school for that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.190
So we can calculate we'll get you reverse score by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,57,100,57,92,97,100]}

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.050
subtracting our score from the highest school, which is for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,100,100,99,99,100,100,96]}

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.080
well, that will give us a negative score of that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,99,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.750
item.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.350
All right, so then what we need we can just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.890
do that for all the others.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99]}

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.270
So again, positive school.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,100,99,99]}

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.720
We just leave for the negative school we have Teo,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,47]}

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.840
subtract the participants school from four and so on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,62,86,100,100,99,99,100]}

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.150
Okay, so that will help us know some the scores.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,100,100,100,100,75,89,86,96]}

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.700
But ultimately, when we do our final calculation, you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,99,100]}

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.860
to remember that you need Teo multiply by 2.5 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,46,91,100,100,95]}

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.350
get that final score.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.590
All right, so here we have an example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.280
This is the formula that you end up within Google

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,72,99]}

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.370
spreadsheets.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.720
Your columns maybe different.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,84,100]}

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.390
So differently labelled.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100]}

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.610
So just watch out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98]}

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.510
Make sure that you have the right labels here might

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.740
not not be the same for you And then at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,90,90,100,99,99,100,100,100]}

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.870
the end, you'll have your score.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,97,100,100,99]}

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.160
A case of this formula is in this cell here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,99,96,100,100,100,100,100,99,100]}

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.020
on you, Khun drag down so that you can calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.990
a ll The other one's a CZ.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,69,72,53]}

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.470
Well, all right, so it's a little bit tricky, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,97,97,100,99,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.210
not impossible.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.180
So if your score is particularly, these are very low

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,99,99,99,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.800
scores.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.080
Normally, schools are a lot higher than this, but this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,85,40,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.110
was scores from our test run of the practise evaluation

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.440
in week seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100]}

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.130
So I don't think people are really thinking too highly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,100,100,100,100,98,99,100,98,100]}

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.060
about it when they did it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,99,99]}

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.040
Okay, so when you've got yourself scores, then you can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,97,100,89,99,100,100,100]}

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.070
put them in your satisfaction table on Dhere.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,99,96]}

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.420
We have sussed scores than for each participant on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,70,57,93,99,100,100,99]}

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.050
We really do want try and much up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,90,100,71,94,96,97,99]}

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.550
You know, each one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,94,100,99]}

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.430
All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,94]}

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.420
And so the final piece of data for our satisfaction

NOTE CONF {"raw":[64,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,99,100]}

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.750
scores is our recommend to a friend.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,84,53,48,74,99]}

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.300
So in one of your spreads.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,77,77,38]}

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.990
Google forms.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99]}

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.750
You've got your post study questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,99,98,100,99]}

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.220
What did you like most?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,100,100]}

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.180
What did you like, Lise?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,97,97,100,92]}

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.410
How could it be improved?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.070
All right, so that's a couple of one's.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,68,100,80,100,100,100,72]}

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.140
What we're looking at here is that How likely is

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.340
it that you would recommend this prototype to a friend

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,93,100,100]}

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.040
or colleague?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.250
All right, so we're looking here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.520
Yep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.470
Number five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100]}

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.670
So we've got that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,93,100,100]}

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.890
And we've got No Yes, Yes, yes, yes, yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.450
For each of our participants.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,99,99]}

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.670
So all we need to do is tow.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,60]}

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.550
Add that into the table.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,100,100,98,100]}

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.480
All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,93]}

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.539
And now we have our recommend to a friend score

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,98,99,98,100,75,99]}

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.050
as well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:35.930
All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,95]}

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.090
So that gives us our data for satisfaction.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,67,93,100,100,100]}

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.729
Well, not all of it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.390
Because we've got one more set on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,91,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.260
That is our open questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100]}

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.590
So our comments that people have and remember, we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,100,100,100,100,99,97,100,100]}

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.070
our what did you like most?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,100,99,99,100,100]}

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.470
All right, so here is some things about what people

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,75,100,55,41,97,97,100,100,100]}

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.950
said about what they like most.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,92,100]}

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.830
Okay, so when you're looking at comment data, sometimes it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,100,100,50,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.810
helpful to go and see if you can see a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,92,100,100,99]}

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.250
theme in the data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100]}

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.830
And it's clear in this particular data that we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,80,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.700
things like, You know, the issues with the food menus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,98,98,51,100,100,100,100,98]}

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.670
menus have complicated.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,53,91]}

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.110
The menu option is hard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100]}

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.420
The menu was confusing, finding the food hard to find.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,91,100,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.220
So there's a rial theme throughout this comments, indicating that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,52,100,100,100,98,100,100]}

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.790
there does seem to be an issue with trying to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.450
find the food so we can use these comments on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,100,100,99,100,100]}

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.160
their own.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,79]}

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.950
But we can also use them to help illustrate how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,99,100,100,98,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:34.290
people went on tasks so later in interpretation, we'll talk

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,76,100,60,99]}

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.690
about this idea of convergence of data.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.510
So that is, you know, you've got lots of errors.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.820
You've got poor task completion.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,97,99,100]}

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.920
You've got long task times on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,100,100,98,96,100]}

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.080
Then you can have these comments which help illustrate you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,99,100,100,100,100,100,69,100,99]}

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.250
know what is causing those debt issues in the performance

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,99,100,100,100,100]}

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.650
data?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.830
Well, the other day, you want them altered to head

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,98,99,99,93,33,74,86]}

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.350
together.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100]}

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.840
All right, s o.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,63,45]}

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.240
That's the end of looking at satisfaction measures.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,100,100,100,100,100,98,97]}

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:10.410
Eso we've got to calculate we've got extract dust difficulties

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,93,100,99,100,97,82,100,81,100]}

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.130
to calculate our suss, score, extract, recommendation, score and also

NOTE CONF {"raw":[32,99,99,88,100,100,55,99,100,100]}

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.330
finally looked through the comments and see if there's anything

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,81,98,100,100,100,99,100,100,100]}

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.610
there that we can get Teo help guide us in

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.950

NOTE CONF {"raw":[100,100,100,100,100,47,43,99]}

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.700

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,99,100,100,100,100,100,97]}

data interpretation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,100]}

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.110
I see that.
